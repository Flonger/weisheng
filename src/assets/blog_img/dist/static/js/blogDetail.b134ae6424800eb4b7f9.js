However, the weighted average lending rate on outstanding loans has increased by 4 basis points. “Going forward, the transmission is expected to improve, given the lags with which banks adjust their deposit and lending rates in response to changes in the policy rate,” added Das.\nRBI deputy governor Viral Acharya expressed concern over the inflation outlook and fiscal slippage. “The upcoming union budget is, therefore, key to understanding the inflation outlook, especially the response to ongoing distress in the agrarian economy, caused in part by low food prices and reflected in low rural inflation of less than 2% compared to urban inflation that remains above 4%,” said Acharya."},{titleMax:"India raises concerns over rising oil prices with Saudi Arabia",titleMin:"Global oil prices rose sharply on fears of a U.S. military attack on Iran that would disrupt flows from the Middle East, which provides more than a fifth of the world's oil output.

So, one can expect a wave-making budget.",author:"R Jagannathan",articleSource:"",articleDate:"May 31, 2019, 10.37 AM IST",imageUrl:"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-69590204,width-300,imgsize-835901,resizemode-4/2.jpg",mainBody:"Two big recusals, Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj, both for reasons of health, paved the way for major changes in portfolios in Narendra Modi’s Cabinet. The irony lies in the fact that both Jaitley and Sushma were seen as potential rivals and claimants to the top job in case the BJP fell short on numbers in 2014. But Modi made sure that didn’t happen. The verdict of 2019 has put paid to any BJP politician harbouring hopes of a hung verdict, where someone other than Modi could have had a shot at No 1.\nTeam Modi 2.0 marks a clear power-shift below the level of Prime Minister, with Amit Shah, who is expected to replace Jaitley in the finance ministry, now likely to position himself as No 2. Shah is clearly a claimant to the top job if and when Modi moves aside. He will be hoping to show that his capabilities are not restricted to the ballot box and panna pramukhs.\nThe oath-taking order, which put Rajnath Singh ahead of Shah, and Nitin Gadkari just after him, indicates the broader hierarchy after the exit of Jaitley and Swaraj. Modi and Shah represent the force that built BJP into the central pole of Indian politics; the other two, Singh and Gadkari, represent the backroom power of the Sangh Parivar, which steps in if and when a power vacuum arises.\nA big caveat: Given the exit of two big names in Jaitley and Swaraj, one wonders if there has been any net gain in talent beyond Shah and former Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar. Suresh Prabhu has been inexplicably dropped. Quite clearly, Modi evaluates his worth differently from Vajpayee. And one minister who was not known for achieving anything in particular, Sadananda Gowda, remains in the cabinet.\nThe inclusion of Jaishankar indicates that when Modi looks for lateral inductions, he prefers to go with tried and tested bureaucrats. Hardeep Puri and RK Singh, two other former bureaucrats who were inducted in Team Modi 1.0, have been retained, and so has former army chief, Gen VK Singh. Jaishankar played a key role along with NSA Ajit Doval in ending the eyeball-to-eyeball with China over Doklam in 2017. As a former ambassador to the US, Jaishankar, if he comes in as External Affairs Minister, is well-placed to deal with the uncertainties that came bundled with Donald Trump.\nThe big change – the induction of Shah -- has the potential to up-end many power equations, both within the Modi government, and outside. Unlike his predecessor, Jaitley, who did not have much of a finance or business background, Shah has actually run a (cooperative) bank and turned it around; he has an acute understanding of the markets, and the capacity to focus on several things at the same time. So, one thing one can expect is a budget that makes waves. Another crucial difference between Jaitley and Shah is that the latter has an eye for detail, while the former was happy to leave it to the bureaucracy to fill in the blanks after the broad policy was enunciated. Shah is likely to be more hands-on at the finance ministry than Jaitley, and given his double clout – in the party and government, and standing as Modi’s closest confidant – the bureaucracy will know that they can’t run rings around him.\nIf the rest of the cabinet picks sound underwhelming, the answers are not far to seek. Consider first the supply side of ministerial aspirants, given the nature of the verdict, where the BJP alone has 303 Lok Sabha MPs and its allies the remaining 50. These numbers rule out too many lateral inductions, for every lateral induction means one less berth to offer to party hopefuls and allies. One ally, the Janata Dal (U) has already opted out of the first stage of cabinetformation as it was not given enough posts by Modi and Shah.\nConsider also the geographical spread of the BJP’s new political footprint, where it has grown eastwards (West Bengal, Odisha and the North-East), and made an exceptionally strong showing in north and west India, apart from Karnataka in the south. No Prime Minister can afford to ignore specific demands for higher representation from the states where the BJP has won big.\nIn sum, the two big take-outs of Team Modi 2.0 are these: one, the cabinet is no longer unipolar, despite Modi’s supremo status. Shah adds new ballast to the team, both from the party angle and governance capabilities. Two, if Shah gets finance, one can expect him to use his heft to revive animal spirits in the economy. He did that in politics, and one cannot presume he can’t repeat the trick with economics.\n(The author is Editorial Director of Swarajya)\n"},{titleMax:"Modi Cabinet: Here is a list of ministers who will be inducted in the new government",titleMin:"Ministers selected for oath of office will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi at his residence at 4.30 today, shortly before the swearing-in ceremony.",author:"",articleSource:"",articleDate:"May 30, 2019, 07.38 PM IST",imageUrl:"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-69577287,width-300,imgsize-182922,resizemode-4/modi_shah_afp.jpg",mainBody:"As Prime Minister Narendra Modi gets ready to take oath for his second tenure later in the day, party president Amit Shah has started calling up likely ministers who will be inducted in the Narendra Modi Cabinet.

BJP won 62 seats in UP, and the Cabinet reflects that. From western UP, the party gave ministerial berths to four MPs.\nMuzaffarnagar MP Sanjeev Balyan, who defeated RLD leader Ajit Singh, has been rewarded for keeping Jat voters intact with the party. Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, a Rajya Sabha member, is the only Muslim face in Modi’s Cabinet.

Purvanchal has got one ministerial berth in UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey.

From Maharashtra, there are seven faces in the new Cabinet. While five are from BJP, one each is from the Shiv Sena and RPI. From Jharkhand, the party chose former CM Arjun Munda for representation in the Cabinet. Munda was a CM candidate in 2014, but he lost the assembly election and Raghubar Das became the CM. The rivalry between the two leaders is well known and by shifting Munda to Delhi, the PM has resolved the leadership issue in the state. Munda is also a strong tribal face from Jharkhand. From Haryana, three out of 10 party MPs have got ministerial berths.

Rajasthan and Gujarat have been given three ministerial positions each while Uttarakhand, Delhi and Himachal have got one each. In Bihar, NDA won 39 out of 40 seats. There are six ministers from the state, including LJP’s Ram Vilas Paswan. Five BJP ministers come from Bhumihar, Brahmin, Rajput, Kayastha and Yadav communities, in line with the BJP’s vote base.\nFrom southern India, BJP has given ministerial positions to six leaders. In Karnataka, where BJP did exceedingly well, the party has given positions to four leaders. These include Nirmala Sitharaman, who is currently a Rajya Sabha member from Karnataka. DV Sadanand Gowda has also been inducted and is likely to get a key portfolio.\nFour-time MP from Dharwad, Pralhad Joshi, and four-time MP from Belgaun, Suresh Angadi, have also been inducted into the new Cabinet.

They knowingly did not report the true state of affairs of the company particularly the negative NOF (net owned funds) and negative CRAR (capital to risk asset ratio), which have resulted in causing loss to the creditors of the company who had lent and invested in the NCDs (non-convertible debentures),” it said.\nAudit partners Sen and Ganesh had cited reliance on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) inspection report rather than stating whether they had obtained the details necessary for the purpose of their audit, SFIO said.\n“The auditor relied on the oral discussion of the company officials with RBI for reporting NOP and CRAR rather than RBI guidelines in FY17-18 and not disclosed this material departure from regulatory requirements and thus caused loss to the creditors of IFIN,” SFIO said. “Auditors with their engagement teams did not use professional skepticism to ensure true and fair disclosure of state of affairs of the companies. They in fact colluded with official of the companies in order to conceal their fraudulent activities and this they failed to perform their duties.”\nThe SFIO pointed to the close ties between Sivasankaran and the erstwhile IFIN directors, citing email exchanges that revealed he allegedly arranged hospitality for Parthasarthy, Kapoor and Sankaran, including private jets, helicopter rides, resort bookings and redecorating the interiors of their apartments in Brussels, besides foreign trips.\n“IFIN had entered into 15 transactions of advancing loans to or investing in debentures of different Siva Group companies,” SFIO said. “Out of the 15 lending transactions, repayment of loans pertaining to only first four transactions were done.”\nLOANS INVOLVING SIVA GROUP\nThe SFIO detailed various loan transactions involving Siva Group companies, including the lack of collateral.\n“In 2014, while lending to Siva India Commercial Traders Pvt Ltd, an additional security in the form of stock of Emerald Stone valued at Rs 59.26 crore was taken,” the charge-sheet said. “As on 31March 2015, the aggregate exposure to Siva Group companies stood at Rs 182.45 crore… The said exposure continued as loan from March 2015 to December 2015, with no security cover as so-called security of Emerald stock was existing only on paper without any physical verification.”\nThe SFIO pointed to emails directing IFIN employees not to securitise outstanding dues while entering into a fresh lending exercise with the Siva Group companies. “It was observed from an email (of) February 1, 2018, (from) Parthasarathy to Sivasankaran that instead of protecting the interest of the company, Parthasarthy is found being apologetic to Sivasankaran for taking time for finalising the loan transaction of Rs 175 crore.”\nCalling the independent directors “mute spectators,” the SFIO said they ignored all warnings and failed to serve the interest of the company and its stakeholders by not raising the issue in board meetings.\n“Investigation revealed that the audit committee members, independent director and CFO, IFIN, and group CFO of IL&FS were aware of the stressed asset portfolio, the modus operandi used for granting loans to group companies of existing defaulting borrowers to prevent them being classified as NPA,” SFIO said. “They connived with the management… they being part of the board were aware of the various RBI reports and overlooked the numerous impairment indicators in contravention of the accounting standard and principals.”\nCounsel Sachin Midha, who was appearing for Bawa, told ET he will apply for bail shortly. “Since the chargesheet has been filed, the SFIO’s contention that Bawa could influence the witness or tamper with the evidence and hence shouldn’t be granted bail, won’t hold ground.”\n"},{titleMax:"Modi govt likely to announce 'big-bang' economic reforms",titleMin:"The reforms could include changes in labour laws, privatisation moves, and creation of land banks.",author:"",articleSource:"",articleDate:"Jun 01, 2019, 06.18 AM IST",imageUrl:"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-69592740,width-300,imgsize-658900,resizemode-4/modinew.jpg",mainBody:"In the first 100 days of PM Narendra Modi's second term, a slew of 'big-bang' economic reforms that should please foreign investors are likely to be pursued, according to a top official at the government's main think tank.\nThe reforms will include changes in labour laws, privatisation moves, and creation of land banks for new industrial development, said Rajiv Kumar, vice chairman of NITI Aayog (National Institute for Transforming India), who reports directly to Modi.\n\"They (foreign investors) will have reasons to be happy. You will see a slew of reforms I can assure you of that. We are going to pretty much hit the ground running,\" Kumar told Reuters in an interview.\nModi is chairman of the think tank. He was sworn into office for his second term on Thursday night. Kumar was speaking before Modi announced members of his new cabinet.\nNiti Aayog, which now acts as the main centre for policy making and for driving new ideas, was founded four years back when Modi scrapped the 65-year old planning commission, saying that India was stifled with Soviet-style bureaucracy.\nKumar said reforms in India's complicated labour laws will see the light of day as early as the next parliamentary session in July, when the government will place a new bill before the lower house for approval.\nIt will aim to combine 44 central laws into four codes – wages, industrial relations, social security and welfare, and the fourth - occupational safety, health and working conditions.\nThis should help companies avoid getting embroiled in a series of complicated disputes with their workers and officials that involve regulations set by authorities at different levels of government and can lead to long, drawn-out adjudication in various parts of the legal system.\nThe government could also offer swathes of land to foreign investors from the land banks it plans to create from unutilised land controlled by public sector enterprises, Kumar said.\n\"What could be attempted is to build an inventory of government land that can then be offered to foreign investors,\" Kumar said.\nThe land parcels could be designed as clusters catering to a specific set of investors or industrial sectors, Kumar said.\nGetting access to some of the large amounts of unutilised Indian government land would reduce major risks for foreign companies as there would be a lot less risk of legal challenges over ownership and development. A lot of the sites they have used in the past was previously farm land, opening them up to protests and court action by local communities over land rights, the environment and other issues.\nKumar said the government will focus on fully privatising or closing more than 42 state-controlled companies in the coming months. The government is even mulling lifting the foreign direct investment cap on Air India, the loss-making state-owned flagship carrier, to make it easier to sell.\nKumar also said that it could create an autonomous holding company that would control all state-owned firms and wouldn't be answerable to lots of different ministries. This would speed up decision making for asset sales, avoiding much of the central government's bureaucracy.\nIndia’s economic growth rate decelerated to a five-year low of 5.8% in the January-March quarter.\nThe economy needs far faster growth if it is to generate enough jobs for the millions of young people entering the labour market each month.\nKumar blamed the stressed balance sheet of banks and a crisis in the shadow lending industry for the recent drop in growth.\nHe suggested the government should start with reforming the state-owned banking sector and also create more money for spending on infrastructure and new public housing through more and quicker privatisations and better tax collection.\n\"We should (start with the banks).. There will be big bang, there will be 100 days action. We are all geared for that ... I have maintained that the fiscal policy should be counter cyclical. There is scope for that.\"\n"},{titleMax:"View: PM Narendra Modi has gathered the perfect folks for the second term",titleMin:"Having Shah onboard means calibrating politics according to its policy delivery rather than other way around.",author:"",articleSource:"",articleDate:"May 31, 2019, 09.56 AM IST",imageUrl:"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-69588060,width-300,imgsize-342656,resizemode-4/modis-cabinet-pti.jpg",mainBody:"By \nSurendra Kumar \nTo flip that old adage on its head - the more things remain the same, the more they change. That seems to be the case with the government of the 17th Lok Sabha, whose members were sworn in on a balmy Thursday evening on the grand forecourt of Rashtrapati Bhavan. As prime minister, Narendra Modi has chosen well. After all, this time it’s not only about consolidation in the Houses of Parliament but also about governance delivery.\nAnd for that purpose, the inclusion of Amit Shah in the Cabinet underlines the fact that this government realises that its politics will have to know its governance, and vice versa. Having someone like Shah in his team means calibrating politics according to its policy delivery rather than the other way around.\nThe other deft call is inducting former foreign secretary Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in the Cabinet. As one of the sharpest minds in the Indian Foreign Service, he understands Modi’s mind and works in a style to the latter’s liking. Apart from being handpicked by the PM, his understanding of China and its leadership can certainly help in Modi’s vision of ‘NARA’ — National Aspiration & Regional Aspiration. Jaishankar’s induction in his Cabinet shows Modi being serious about having experts in his team.\nRegardless of having ups and downs in her roles in the previous Modi government - as human resource development (HRD) minister, as information & broadcasting minister, and as textiles minister — Smriti Irani has certainly learnt on the job. More than a reward for defeating Congress president Rahul Gandhi in Amethi in this Lok Sabha polls, one would presume that Modi finds her tenacity in this government’s ‘New India’ worthwhile.\nIn a way, the prime minister too has learnt - and has shaped his new Cabinet - on the job during his last tenure. The value of ministers who served in the first Modi government — such as minister for road transport and highways, shipping and water Resources Nitin Gadkari, defence minister (and prior to that, minister of state for finance and corporate affairs Nirmala Sitharaman, law and justice, and electronics and information technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, and minister of railways and of coal Piyush Goyal, has been duly recognised.\nThis marks a healthy continuity. Call it in cricketing terms, those familiar with the run-up that now hopes to let loose delivery.\nThe Omissions Now, for the omissions. It was well known the moment she announced she would not be campaigning for her party this elections due to ill-health Sushma Swaraj was probably not going to continue the splendid job she had been doing as India’s external affairs minister during the last five years. Her sagacity and poise, the twin pillars of diplomacy’s ‘walk and talk’, will be missed. Finance minister Arun Jaitley recusing himself from this government rightfully made headlines.\nOne hopes him good health —even as the shoes his successor will have to fill in will, indeed, be big and daunting. The exclusion of commerce and industry minister and civil aviation minister Suresh Prabhu may seem intriguing, but considering the ruckus over Indian airspace involving Air India and Jet Airways et al, a fresh face (sans kid gloves?) may be the new government’s answer. Not to mention reassigning Prabhu to ‘other things’.\nIt’s too early to say whether this is going to be Modi 2.0’s ‘Dream Team’. And the next five-year stretch itself will probably have its fair share of tweaks and changes as square pegs are fitted into square holes while some round pegs may not immediately fit into their requisite gaps. But with this formation of ministers, Modi has shown that he and his government means business. By which one means the business of the economy, national security, addressing and implementing social welfare not just in terms of schemes, but with structures more permanent.\nFocus On Delivery \nThe fact that the people of India have given Prime Minister Narendra Modi such a resounding mandate also means that this returning prime minister will have to deliver much. If one considers this the beginning of the second half of the ‘Modi decade’, then today’s team formation to propel this mission has also started its opening gambit.\nHaving found the room and space to deliver on its intentions and promises, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will now have to deliver for India.

The amount lying in the corpus of your provident fund account (under the Employees' Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952) at the time of switching your job is one aspect which many a times is not given importance by the employee. A little caution exercised can help the employee to save tax and ensure that the benefit of compounding of the retiral corpus is available over a period of time. \nThe contribution to PF is two-fold; employer contribution and employee contribution. The employee contribution is eligible for deduction u/s 80C of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (the Act) and as per the existing provisions of the Act the employer contribution to PF falls under the \"EEE\" category. This means that the contribution made by the employer on behalf of the employee is exempt from tax (provided the amount contributed by your employer is up to 12 percent of salary), the interest earned on the said contribution is exempt and the withdrawals from the fund are also exempt subject to certain conditions. \nThe accumulated balance due and becoming payable to an employee participating in a recognised provident fund shall be exempt in the following cases -\n(i) If the employee has rendered continuous service with his employer for a period of 5 years or more, or \n(ii) If, though he has not rendered such continuous service of 5 years, the service has been terminated (a) by reason of such employee's ill health or (b) by the contraction or discontinuance of the employer's business or (c) or other cause beyond the control of the employee, or \n(iii) If, on the cessation of his employment, the employee obtains employment with any other employer, to the extent the accumulated balance due and becoming payable to him is transferred to his individual account in any recognized fund maintained by such other employer (the process of transferring has now been simplified by the PF authorities). \nIn the case referred in point (iii) above, for the purposes of calculating the period of continuous service of 5 years, the time spent with the previous employer shall also be counted. In other words, say Mr. A works with ABC Pvt. Ltd for 2 years. ABC Pvt. Ltd. had a recognised provident fund. After completion of 2 years Mr. A resigns. He does not withdraw his accumulated balance lying in his PF account. After a gap of 1 month he gets a job with XYZ Pvt. Ltd and then transfers his accumulated balance of PF to his individual account in a recognised PF maintained by the new employer. If he serves a period of 3 years with XYZ then he would fulfill the condition of rendition of service for continuous period of 5 years. The gap in the employment for one month will not be considered for the purposes of counting the continuous period of 5 years. Further, the interest earned on the accumulated balance during the period when the employee is not in employment would be taxable in the year of credit of such interest as per the decision of the Bangalore ITAT in the case of Dilip Ranjrekar.\nThere could be a case where the employee is not able to find a new job or the employee takes a break/sabbatical (especially in the case of women employees). Irrespective of the period of break, as per the latest Government guidelines, the account will earn interest. As and when the employee rejoins work he/she can get the PF account transferred using the Unique Account Number (UAN is a number allotted to every PF account holder). In such a case, the PF account of the employee would get transferred to the account of the new employer. \nIf the accumulated balance due to an employee participating in a recognized provident fund is paid to him otherwise than in the circumstances referred to above i.e. where the employee voluntarily resigns from his/her employment before the completion of 5 years' service with the employer and withdraws the accumulated balance of PF, then the amount paid to the employee would be subject to tax. The tax would be levied on the aggregate amount of the employer's contribution, interest thereon and the interest earned on the employee's own contribution. As far as the principal amount of investment made by the employee is concerned, the same would be taxable if the employee has claimed a deduction u/s 80C of the Act.\n The taxation is triggered in the year of withdrawal; however, the tax is computed as per the mechanism laid down in Rule 9 of the Fourth Schedule to the Act. The Income tax return form has also been amended to align the taxability and the disclosure requirements in accordance with the said Rule. As per the said Rule, the tax is computed for each of the earlier years as if the fund was not a recognized fund and the differential tax is worked out which has to be paid in the year of withdrawal. This means that the tax to be paid on the withdrawal is calculated as per what would have been payable by the individual if no deduction were allowed for EPF and according to income tax slab applicable to him/her at that time. \nAt the time of switching jobs, the employee therefore must decide whether he/she wants to withdraw the amount of corpus and pay tax and utilize the money or to get his/her individual PF account transferred to his/her individual account in any recognized provident fund maintained by the new employer. Of course, the latter option is available only if the person does take up another job where he/she becomes a member of the EPF again.\n(The author is a practising chartered accountant.)\n"},{titleMax:"Railways, roads and highways sector to get the largest chunk of investment in Modi 2.0: ICRA",titleMin:"The BJP in its manifesto proposed to construct 12,000 kms of national highways every year till 2024.",author:"Nishtha Saluja",articleSource:"",articleDate:"May 31, 2019, 06.22 AM IST",imageUrl:"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-69586127,width-300,imgsize-1247148,resizemode-4/road-bccl.jpg",mainBody:'Railways, roads and highways sector are to get the largest chunk of investment over the next five years as the government is expected to spend Rs 30 trillion in the transport sector in India, market research firm ICRA said.\nTaking cues from the BJP manifesto, ICRA said that railways is expected to receive a financial outlay of Rs 10-12 trillion over the next five years while up to Rs 9 trillion is expected to be pumped into the roads and highways sector.\n“Amongst the key segments, transport infrastructure is expected to see a major jump with an estimated Rs. 25-30 trillion of capital outlay over the next five years.

The meetings with important Chinese personalities that Jaishankar had set up for Modi impressed him – the CM was not exactly a popular world leader then.\nWhile Indian envoys in some other countries that Modi visited as CM did not accord him adequate importance, Jaishankar proved to be different.\n"},{titleMax:"Modi Cabinet: Meet the key members of his new team",titleMin:"PM Narendra Modi's A-team is mostly comprised of experienced members.

Access to cooking gas expanded to more than 94% of the country’s households from 56% five years ago. Deregulation of diesel reignited interest from private and foreign companies in the fuel retailing business and helped cut fuel subsidies. A gas pipeline that will take gas to much of eastern India is nearing completion while a record number of city gas licences have been distributed. Pradhan’s unfinished agenda includes getting more foreign and private players to enter the upstream business, building a gas grid and developing a domestic gas market.\nDharmendra Pradhan \nExperience: 1.

His political career has largely remained noncontroversial.\nSadananda Gowda  \nExperience: 1. Minister for statistics and programme implementation (2016)\n2. Minister for law & justice (2015)\n3. CM of Karnataka (2011)\n\nThaawar Chand Gehlot, 71 (BJP Rajya Sabha MP, Madhya Pradesh): Considered close to the PM and an old BJP loyalist, Gehlot is the most recognisable face for scheduled castes in the Modi government.

Naqvi started his career as a student leader and actively participated in several movements, including JP Movement. Naqvi is a spokesperson of the party and was one of the 11 BJP V-P’s appointed by Amit Shah in 2014.\nMukhtar Abbas Naqvi \nExperience: 1. Minister for minority affairs (Sept-May 2019)\n2. MoS for parliamentary affairs (2014-2017)\n3. MoS for I&B with additional charge of parliamentary affairs (2001-2003)\n\nHarsimrat Kaur Badal, 52 years (Shiromani Akali Dal MP, Bhatina, Punjab): Harsimrat Kaur Badal was minister for food processing industries in the first Modi cabinet. She is credited with allowing 100% FDI in food processing industries. Her focus was also on creating a cold chain network and mega food parks. She launched Operation Green to develop infrastructure for preservation, storage and value addition of TOP (tomato, onion and potato) besides setting up a special Nabard fund to provide affordable credit in designated food parks. Badal was also successful in getting food and agro-based processing units classified under agricultural activities for priority sector lending.\nHarsimrat Kaur Badal \nExperience: 1. Minister for food processing industries (2014-2019)\nPrakash Javadekar, 68 (BJP Rajya Sabha MP, Maharashtra): Javadekar served in four ministries in the first stint of the Modi government.

MoS (independent charge) for environment, forests and climate change (May 2014-Oct 2016)\n\nHarsh Vardhan, 64 (BJP Lok Sabha MP, Chandni Chowk, Delhi): A popular politician in the Capital, Harsh Vardhan has held two portfolios in the Modi government – environment, forests and climate change and science and technology. He was the BJP’s chief ministerial candidate for the Delhi assembly elections in 2013. Harsh Vardhan has been credited with major upsets. In 2014 parliamentary elections he defeated Kapil Sibal from Chandni Chowk and in 2019 he defeated Delhi Congress’ former president Jai Prakash Aggrawal. Harsh Vardhan has served as Delhi’s health minister and has been credited with successful implementation of Pulse Polio programme. With assembly elections due in Delhi in 2020, Harsh Vardhan may have to play a role in the BJP’s scheme of things.\nHarsh Vardhan \nExperience: 1. Minister for science & technology (2017-19)\n2.

A firebrand leader from Rajasthan, he’s credited with the expansion of Jodhpur airport. An old RSS hand, Shekhawat has worked extensively in Barmer’s border villages. In 2014, he contested his first election from Jodhpur. In Delhi, he carved a formidable political place for himself. This time, he defeated Vaibhav Gehlot, son of CM Ashok Gehlot and was rewarded with a promotion to Cabinet. As an MP, he has been one of the prominent debating faces of BJP in Parliament. Shekhawat is close to BJP president Amit Shah and being a Rajput face from Rajasthan plays an important role in BJP’s scheme of things. He is a known Vasundhara Raje detractor and could be leadership’s next choice as CM candidate of BJP although the elections are only in 2023.\nGajendra Singh Shekhawat \nExperience: 1.

The noise on need to ‘reform’ is only getting louder as he gets ready to run the world’s fastest-expanding major economy for the next five years – with a bigger mandate.\nTo be sure, reform means many things to many people.\nFor equity investors, reforms are decisions leading to higher corporate earnings essential for driving stock prices up. If investment activity is muted, they would call for government spending even if doing so is imprudent. This is a crowd that doesn’t bother about inflation. In fact, it would celebrate price rise even without productivity gains. Inflation means higher profits, more dividend and ever rising equity valuations.\nFor bond investors, reform is government being prudent. If it borrows more, it would crowd out private investments. It hates inflation because it lowers the value of bonds. If yields spike, it is bad even for the government because it ends up paying more for its own debt. It also hurts future generations as they end up paying the debt the current generation accumulates.\nFor the corporate world, the burden of compliance should be lesser. Industry chambers forever want lower tax rates on everything from the Audi Q7 to an Atlas bicycle. Curiously, in the name of uniform GST rate, they are demanding the same treatment for goods of essential consumption and those of conspicuous consumption. They always look for concessions for investment and ‘tax-holidays’. During ET’s first Global Business Summit, Prime Minister Modi summed up the attitude well. “If you give something to the poor, it is a subsidy that is bad. If you give something to industry, it is incentive.”\nFor wealthy individuals, it is low or even nil taxation on their investments because they are contributing to nation building. All the investments they make should be tax exempt — be it mutual funds, private equity or start-ups. Unless you do it, the entrepreneurial eco-system wouldn’t flourish.\nFor giant corporations, government rules must ensure that entry barriers are high. Their argument is that customer service is so important that small companies would lack economies of scale and consumers end up paying higher prices. But the opposite is true. Industries which are dominated by duopoly or oligopoly structure end up squeezing consumers in the long run and the economy loses out.\nFor non-banking finance companies, the Reserve Bank of India is a heartless beast that fails to acknowledge their role in providing livelihood for millions of families. They provide credit to a bunch of less creditworthy borrowers risking their capital; so they should be treated kindly. They are not open to the prudential norms that guide banks but want the regulator to be their lender of first resort.\nIf the administration panders to the demand of all, public policy would end up encouraging crony capitalism rather than creating a level playing field for long run benefits. While fans of John Maynard Keynes would be quick to point out that “in the long run we are all dead”, policy makers have to be mindful of that.\nThe Oxford Dictionary defines reform in these words: “Make changes in (something, especially an institution or practice) in order to improve it.”\nGoing by this definition, what did Modi 1.0 do? Three institutional changes come to mind:\n1) Independence of monetary policy, with the formation of a Monetary Policy Committee that decides on interest rates. The structure frees decision-making even from the Governor, who is appointed by the government.\n2) Legislation on bankruptcy. For decades, lenders were at the mercy of borrowers. Now, however, someone who has lent money can take away the assets. That bankers, who were earlier complaining about the lack of such policy support, are not using the mechanism willingly is a signal that the way they do business is changing.\n3) Goods and Services Tax. It was a Herculean task that someone as diplomatic as Arun Jaitley (who is out of the race for finance minister now) alone could achieve it. He gave up half his powers by surrendering taxation to the GST Council for a greater good.\nStructural changes would not reflect in improvements overnight. These take years to sink into the system and the benefits would be reaped over the years. Like it was when Prime Minister Narasimha Rao opened up the economy in 1991, with local industry complaining about competition. The fruits are there for everyone to see.\nA finance minister can give direction to an economy and not drive it. Meddling with banks to bring down interest rates and pushing them to lend to projects can give a feeling the government is active, but it would backfire like it did with the UPA government. Jaitley resisted the temptation.\nModi-Jaitley combo rarely indulged in headline grabbing stuff that was routine with P Chidambaram as finance minister. Headlines can be numerous, but what matters is delivering on structural change. The economy may be better off with a Jaitley-like character in the North Block than Chidambaram.\n"},{titleMax:"FY19 growth slumps to five-year low of 6.8%",titleMin:"The economy had grown 6.6% in the third quarter, 7.1% in second and 8.2% in the first quarter.",author:"",articleSource:"",articleDate:"Jun 01, 2019, 08.16 AM IST",imageUrl:"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-69598003,width-300,imgsize-226940,resizemode-4/gdp-bccl.jpg",mainBody:"India’s economy grew slower than expected to a 20-quarter low in the January-March period, dragging overall growth to a five-year low in FY19, presenting the first big challenge for the second Narendra Modi government that took charge Friday. Following on from this, the central bank is widely expected to cut interest rates further next week to bolster the flagging economy.\nThe provisional estimates for FY19 released on Friday showed that the economy grew 5.8% in the fourth quarter of FY19 against 6.6% in the preceding one and 8.1% in the year earlier.\nOverall growth for FY19 slumped to a five-year low of 6.8% compared with 7% projected in the second advance estimates released in February. Full-year growth in value added terms was lower at 6.6%, compared with 6.9% in FY18.\nChina’s economy, in comparison, grew 6.4% in the quarter ended March but for the full year, India still remained the fastest-growing major economy in the world.\nNBFC Stress Hurt Q4 Numbers: Garg\n“Slowdown in the fourth quarter… was due to temporary factors like stress in nonbanking financial company (NBFC) sector affecting consumption finance,” said finance secretary Subhash Garg.\nNBFCs have been under liquidity pressure after the shock default by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) in September last year.\nGarg said the first quarter of the current fiscal would also witness relatively slow growth but would then pick up from the second quarter onward with capital spending, including private investment, expected to revive.\nThe new government’s first budget, to be presented by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 5, is expected to include measures to lift economic growth and revive demand. Sitharaman took charge of the ministry on Friday.\n“The downward trend is because of agriculture and manufacturing. Various sectors have not performed well, which has been reflected,” said chief statistician Pravin Srivastava.\nPrivate final consumption expenditure in the year rose 8.1% and capital investment as measured by gross fixed capital formation expanded 10% from 9.3% in the previous fiscal.\nIndia’s per-capita income increased 10% to Rs 10,534 per month in 2018-19 from Rs 9,580 in FY19. The per-capita income is an indicator of the prosperity of a country.\nWhile some experts expect the formation of the new government will provide an impetus to the economy, others felt there could be more pain ahead.\n“Policy uncertainty is behind us, oil prices are within range and the currency is stable. However, we expect a maximum 30 basis point increase in growth and we expect growth to be close to 7% in FY20,” said Shubhada Rao, chief economist at Yes Bank. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.\n“Going ahead, this weakness might continue for a quarter or so more, and after that growth will start moving up,” said DK Joshi, chief economist at Crisil, adding that growth could cross 7% in FY20.\nThe government’s ability to provide a big spending push could be limited.\n \n“Clearly, the economy is slowing down and these numbers would be a cause of worry for the new central government,” said Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist, India Ratings. “Given the budgeted fiscal deficit at 3.4% of GDP, Ind-Ra believes the head room available to provide fiscal stimulus is limited.”\nAgriculture contracted 0.1% in the fourth quarter against 2.8% growth in the third quarter and 6.5% growth in the corresponding period last year. Manufacturing growth slowed to 3.1% from 6.4% in the trailing quarter.\nMONETARY POLICYAfter the formation of the government, all eyes are on the Reserve Bank of India. It has lowered the key rate twice in succession and is expected to reduce it further. Economists expect more rate cuts amid projections of a weak first quarter of FY20. The next monetary policy announcement is on June 6.\nA further reduction in rates is expected to lift sagging consumer demand. Passenger vehicle sales grew at their slowest in five years, at 2.7% in FY19.\n“Weak rural activity indicators have also been impeding growth recovery as captured in low rural wages, slowdown in credit to medium scale industries and nascent recovery in two-wheeler and commercial vehicle sales,” said B Prasanna, group head, global markets, sales, trading and research, ICICI Bank.\n \n"},{titleMax:"Nitin Gadkari faces dual challenge as transport and MSME minister",titleMin:"While Gadkari is confident on his highway plan, he has his task cut out for MSMEs.

His career suffered a brief setback in 2010, when he, as the MoS home of Gujarat, was arrested in the Sohrabuddin Shaikh and Tulsiram Prajapati encounter cases. He was granted bail on the condition that he would stay away from Gujarat. But Shah used his time in Delhi to not just sort out his legal problems but also understand the nitty-gritty of national politics.\nImmediately after the 2014 LS polls, Shah was elevated to BJP president. Incidentally, Shah honed his political skills in his home state Gujarat, where he started as a booth manager in the Gandhinagar constituency – the seat which he won this year with a record margin of 5.57 lakh votes. When he’s not busy with politics, Shah likes playing chess and watching theatre. He also likes to learn new languages.Rajnath Singh: Defence Minister31 May, 2019Experience: 2 Lok Sabha, 2 Rajya Sabha Terms\nOutgoing minister: Nirmala Sitaraman\nA seasoned politician of many decades and former party president, Rajnath Singh was instrumental in pitching for Narendra Modi as prime minister, as mandated by the RSS. In the last government, he was an efficient home minister who kept a low profile. He implemented the party’s tough line on terror, asking security agencies to act impartially on intelligence inputs. He also adopted a policy of rehabilitation for individuals who might have been radicalised, but had not yet committed a crime and were open to reconsidering their choices.\nAs a former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, his presence will balance caste and regional equations in the top levels of government. He has experience as a political manager, having been drafted in to seal alliances and sort out inner-party crises in the past.Nirmala Sitharaman: Finance Minister31 May, 2019Experience: 2 Rajya Sabha Terms\nOutoing Minister: Arun Jaitley\nThe last five years have seen a meteoric rise of this former JNU student, who joined the BJP just over a decade ago. She was nominated as party spokesperson in 2010. Under the government led by AB Vajpayee, she served as a member of the NCW 2003 till 2005.\nThe two time Rajya Sabha member started out in May 2014 as an unsure minister of state with independent charge of commerce and industry. In September 2017, she went on to become India’s first full-time woman defence minister and a member of the hallowed cabinet committee on security.\nAs the ‘Raksha Mantri’, Sitharaman took some time to find her feet in the complex defence ministry, and the overwhelmingly male dominated environs of the armed forces, with all its national security challenges. It was, of course, not easy to follow heavy-weight predecessors like Pranab Mukherjee, A K Antony, Arun Jaitley and Manohar Parrikar.\nShe was also confronted with the tough task of countering Congress’ charge of crony capitalism in the Rs 59,000-crore Rafale deal, inked during Parrikar’s tenure. She vigourously defended the government’s stand on the defence deal. There was persistent talk she was kept out of the loop on major decisions, like the pre-dawn air strikes on the JeM facility in Balakot. But the earnest minister, who rarely smiles, did not let go. She retains PM Modi’s trust.Subrahmanyam Jaishankar: External Affairs Minister31 May, 2019Experience: No Parliamentary Experience\nOutgoing: Sushma Swaraj\nFormer foreign secretary S Jaishankar’s induction in the Modi government as an MoS is hardly a surprise to foreign policy wonks. Jaishankar, son of the strategic affairs expert K Subrahmanyam, has been Modi’s go-to man on foreign policy since his Gujarat CM days. Jaishankar was then India’s ambassador to China, and the two met whenever Modi visited. In January 2015, Jaishankar was days away from his retirement when he was dramatically made foreign secretary by Modi. As foreign secretary, Jaishankar worked the back channels to end the India-China standoff at Doklam. His tenure as FS was later extended by a year. Jaishankar joined the Tata group three months after his retirement and after the “cooling-off period’’ of a year for bureaucrats was waived off by the government in his case.\nAn IFS officer from the 1977 batch, he served as India’s ambassador to the US, China Singapore and Czech Republic. He also led the negotiations for the India-US nuclear deal between 2004 and 2008.Next \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi had earlier announced a credit guarantee fund with a corpus of Rs 2,000 crore to provide funding facilities to startups in the country, as part of the Startup India action plan in January 2016. The BJP-led government had also announced a Rs 10,000-crore fund of funds managed by the Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi) in 2016.\nHowever, less than 20% of the corpus has been allocated to alternative investment funds as of November 2018, with the total commitment standing at Rs 1,611 crore, according to the Startup India status report.

Jaishankar is the big surprise, and Sushma the shock omission. As the 58 shades of Team Modi are unveiled in a US-style inauguration, TOI introduces you to the newbies and veterans.\nRAJNATH SINGH | 67 Born: July 10, 1951\nExperience: 2 Lok Sabha, 2 Rajya Sabha Terms\nA seasoned politician of many decades and former party president, Rajnath Singh was instrumental in pitching for Narendra Modi as prime minister, as mandated by the RSS. In the last government, he was an efficient home minister who kept a low profile. He implemented the party’s tough line on terror, asking security agencies to act impartially on intelligence inputs. He also adopted a policy of rehabilitation for individuals who might have been radicalised, but had not yet committed a crime and were open to reconsidering their choices.\nAs a former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, his presence will balance caste and regional equations in the top levels of government. He has experience as a political manager, having been drafted in to seal alliances and sort out inner-party crises in the past.\nAMIT SHAH | 54 \nBorn: Oct 22, 1964\nExperience: 1 Rajya Sabha Term\nFrom a polling booth in-charge to heading the world’s largest political party to cabinet minister, the journey of BJP president Amit Anilchandra Shah has been stupendous to say the least.\nFor 14 years in Gujarat, Shah was the most trusted lieutenant of then CM Narendra Modi. His career suffered a brief setback in 2010, when he, as the MoS home of Gujarat, was arrested in the Sohrabuddin Shaikh and Tulsiram Prajapati encounter cases. He was granted bail on the condition that he would stay away from Gujarat. But Shah used his time in Delhi to not just sort out his legal problems but also understand the nitty-gritty of national politics. After two years away, he was allowed to return in 2012. He was subsequently discharged of all charges. Perhaps the most crucial phase of Shah’s career began in 2013, when he was made general secretary of the BJP and was tapped to spearhead the 2014 general election campaign in Uttar Pradesh. Realising the importance of UP, Shah spent almost an entire year there, working on the minutest of details, which eventually gave the party and its allies 73 of the 80 LS seats in UP.\nImmediately after the 2014 LS polls, Shah was elevated to BJP president. In the first year of his tenure, the BJP won four of the five assembly elections held. Since then, with Modi at the helm of government and Amit Shah captaining the organisation that he transformed into a well-oiled electoral machine, the BJP has expanded its footprint across the country.\nIncidentally, Shah honed his political skills in his home state Gujarat, where he started as a booth manager in the Gandhinagar constituency – the seat which he won this year with a record margin of 5.57 lakh votes. When he’s not busy with politics, Shah likes playing chess and watching theatre. He also likes to learn new languages. His family continues to live in their house in Ahmedabad. Whenever he comes home, it’s his granddaughter Rudri who takes up most of his time.\n \nS JAISHANKAR | 64 Born: Jan 9, 1955No Parliamentary Experience\nF Former foreign secretary S Jaishankar’s induction in the Modi government as an MoS is hardly a surprise to foreign policy wonks. Jaishankar, son of the strategic affairs expert K Subrahmanyam, has been Modi’s go-to man on foreign policy since his Gujarat CM days. Jaishankar was then India’s ambassador to China, and the two met when- e v e r M o d i visited. In January 2015, Jaishankar was days away from his retirement when he was dramatically made foreign secretary by Modi. As foreign secretary, Jaishankar worked the back channels to end the India-China standoff at Doklam. His tenure as FS was later extended by a year. Jaishankar joined the Tata group three months after his retirement and after the “cooling-off period’’ of a year for bureaucrats was waived off by the government in his case.\nAn IFS officer from the 1977 batch, he served as India’s ambassador to the US, China Singapore and Czech Republic. He also led the negotiations for the India-US nuclear deal between 2004 and 2008.\nNITIN GADKARI | 62 Born: May 27, 1957Experience: 1 Lok Sabha Term\nThe feisty leader recently cemented his electoral muscle in Nagpur, which is home to the RSS headquarters, with a second Lok Sabha win.\nGadkari earned his spurs as PWD minister in Maharashtra by delivering the Mumbai-Pune expressway and 55 flyovers in Mumbai, earning him sobriquets like ‘bridge bhushan’ and ‘flyover man’.\nHowever, Gadkari’s straight-shooting often gives rise to controversies. Last year, he said the government would not give the Navy an inch of land for housing in South Mumbai. Or even more embarrassing, he said it was wrong to call fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya a thief after one loan default. In the last few months, he made several cryptic comments that were seen as barbs at the leadership.\nAll that seems water under the bridge now, and the RSS favourite is once again in the driver’s seat. After all, not only does he have a strong record as union minister for road transport and shipping, he has also been BJP’s trouble shooter in Goa, sorting out the political chaos that ensued after the death of Manohar Parrikar. This wasn’t the first time Gadkari was asked to pitch in. In 2017, when BJP failed to get a majority in the Goa Assembly polls, Gadkari had flown to the state to help the party cobble up an alliance with smaller partners, after which a government was formed under Parrikar’s leadership.\nNIRMALA SITHARAMAN | 59 Born: Aug 18, 1959Experience: 2 Rajya Sabha Terms\nThe last five years have seen a meteoric rise of this former JNU student, who joined the BJP just over a decade ago. She was nominated as party spokesperson in 2010. Under the government led by AB Vajpayee, she served as a member of the NCW 2003 till 2005.\nThe two time Rajya Sabha member started out in May 2014 as an unsure minister of state with independent charge of commerce and industry. In September 2017, she went on to become India’s first full-time woman defence minister and a member of the hallowed cabinet committee on security.\nAs the ‘Raksha Mantri’, Sitharaman took some time to find her feet in the complex defence ministry, and the overwhelmingly male dominated environs of the armed forces, with all its national security challenges. It was, of course, not easy to follow heavy-weight predecessors like Pranab Mukherjee, A K Antony, Arun Jaitley and Manohar Parrikar.\nShe was also confronted with the tough task of countering Congress’ charge of crony capitalism in the Rs 59,000-crore Rafale deal, inked during Parrikar’s tenure. She vigourously defended the government’s stand on the defence deal. There was persistent talk she was kept out of the loop on major decisions, like the pre-dawn air strikes on the JeM facility in Balakot. But the earnest minister, who rarely smiles, did not let go. She retains PM Modi’s trust.\nHARSIMRAT KAUR BADAL | 52 Born: July 25, 1966Experience: 2 Lok Sabha Terms\nThe Badal bahu, Harsimrat Kaur, has only seen highs in her first decade as a politician — she is a three-time MP from the Badal stronghold of Bathinda, was a minister with independent charge in PM Narendra Modi’s first government and now has made it to the Cabinet. She also made history for the Shiromani Akali Dal — she is the first MP in its 98-year history to be made a Union minister twice in consecutive terms.\nHer father Satyajit Singh Majithia and grandfather Surjit Singh Majithia were Congress politicians and it was her marriage to Sukhir, only son of SAD patriarch Parkash Singh Badal, in 1991 that shifted her family’s allegiance to the Akalis. Her younger brother Bikram Majithia is a SAD MLA and was a minister during Badal Senior’s tenure as chief minister.\nHarsimrat actively campaigned for her husband in 1996 when he contested his first Lok Sabha election from Faridkot. However, her entry into politics in 2009 created news — she defeated Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh’s son Raninder by over 1.2 lakh votes in Bathinda. She was reelected in 2014 by defeating her husband’s estranged cousin Manpreet Singh Badal, the current finance minister of Punjab. Her third straight election was not a cakewalk, especially with voter anger against SAD. However, she managed to defeat Congress MLA Amrinder Singh Raja Warring by 21,772 votes.\nSMRITI IRANI | 43 Born: March 23, 1976\nFrom Miss India contestant to soap opera star to giant slayer, Smriti Irani’s career has not had a dull moment. Irani captured India’s imagination as ‘Tulsi’ in one of the most successful running soaps of all time. In 2004, when most would have been thinking of graduating to a film career, Irani chose politics running an unsuccessful but feisty campaign against Kapil Sibal from Chandni Chowk. In a nod to her fighting spirit, Irani was made Rajya Sabha member in 2011, and held several positions in parliamentary committees till 2014 when she challenged Congress president Rahul Gandhi in Amethi. She lost the poll battle but won a cabinet position in the Modi government.\nControversies though were not far behind (least of which were her “fake”\neducational qualification), and soon she was divested of the ‘sensitive’ HRD portfolio to I&B ministry. There, too, a controversial proposal to reign in ‘fake news’ placed the government in crisis that could only be defused after the notification was withdrawn. She appeared to have lost favour and moved to textiles but her dogged campaign against the ‘lapata saansad’ (read Rahul Gandhi) which led to a shock victory in the Gandhi pocket borough of Amethi has cemented her political career.\nNARENDRA TOMAR | 61 Born: June 12, 1957Experience: 2 Lok Sabha Terms\nSeen as the tallest BJP leader in Madhya Pradesh after former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Was minister of panchayat and rural development and mines in the outgoing Modi Cabinet. After taking oath, he immediately chalked out a 100-day road map to execute the development agenda of the Modi government, and promoted skill development. During the 2019 Lok Sabha election, when sitting MPs were being ruthlessly weeded out if there was even a hint of anti-incumbency, Tomar was the only one allowed to change his seat from Gwalior to Morena. This is an indication of his clout in the party. Beyond politics, Tomar’s interests lie in sports and poetry, and he is known for organizing poetry symposiums.\nHARSH VARDHAN | 64 Born: Dec 13, 1954\nFondly known as ‘doctor saab’ in Delhi circles, Harsh Vardhan is among BJP’s old world politicians. The good doctor, who has held ministerial portfolios in the Centre and the state, nurtured the same assembly constituency —Krishna Nagar in east Delhi — since 1992 till he shifted to Chandni Chowk for the 2014 Lok Sabha election. As health minister in Delhi, he earned recognition for the universal coverage of the polio campaign.\nAs Union environment minister, he is credited with motivating the country’s scientists to come up with new technologies, processes and products that can provide innovative solutions to people’s problems. But in recent years, he has been known more for his controversial remarks than significant work. In 2014, as union health minister he advocated fidelity rather than use of condoms to tackle AIDS. Then in 2018 as science and technology minister he announced that cosmologist Stephen Hawking had declared the Vedas were superior to Einstein’s theory of relativity. It later turned out that he had fallen for a fake Facebook page. As environment minister, he rubbished claims that bad air was killing people.\nDHARMENDRA PRADHAN | 49 Born: June 26, 1969Experience: 1 Lok Sabha Term\nThough the Naveen Patnaik era continues in Odisha, Pradhan’s efforts as leader of BJP’s campaign in the state did result in big gains in the Lok Sabha election. In the state too, BJP has replaced Congress as the number two party and seems well established to be the main challenger to Biju Janata Dal.\nAs the Union minister of petroleum and natural gas, Pradhan led the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, a key initiative of the Narendra Modi government. This saw a sharp rise in LPG households from 20 lakh in 2014 to almost 78 lakh in February 2019. This, along with the #GiveUp scheme where middle-class households were urged by the government to give up LPG subsidy so that the social benefit could go to those who needed it, has been widely accepted as a pro-poor reform that helped BJP make inroads in the electorate.\nRAM VILAS PASWAN | 72 Born: July 5, 1946\nPaswan is known as the ‘mausam vaigyanik’ (weather vane) for his ability to read political currents correctly. This time, too, his prediction that BJP under Modi was headed back to office was proved right. However, LJP chief did have a disagreement with the NDA over division of seats, but managed to drive a hard bargain, wrangling six seats. And despite the Modi wave in much of India, LJP won all six. His portfolio — Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution — may not have been the weightiest, but Paswan’s inputs on political issues did prove useful. He was the one who insisted that the income support under the PM-Kisan Yojna should be direct transfers. There was talk that his son Chirag would get the berth this time but junior was more interested in leading LJP in the Bihar polls.\nPIYUSH GOYAL | 54 Born: June 13, 1964Experience: 2 Rajya Sabha Terms\nThe chartered accountant was seen as a performer in the Modi government after he successfully oversaw auctions of coal blocks that were cancelled by the Supreme Court.\nHis next challenge was to improve power supply and he did that by seeking to make utilities more efficient, while helping many of them avoid bankruptcy. Between all this, he successfully managed to push LED bulbs and renewable energy and ensured that nearly every household had an electricity connection.\nA trusted aide of Modi, Goyal was the man the PM could count on to handle varied portfolios. Besides his own MoS for coal, power and renewable energy, Goyal also filled in for Arun Jaitley in the finance ministry when he was unwell. The low-profile Goyal comes from political legacy. His father Ved Prakash Goyal was minister for transport in the Atal Behari Vajpayee government while his mother Chandrakanta was a three-term MLA from Matunga in Mumbai. A chartered accountant and investment banker, Goyal was on the board of directors of Bank of Baroda and State Bank of India.\nGoyal has been associated with BJP since 1984. He was a member of the national executive and national campaign in-charge for the Lok Sabha elections for a prolonged period. He is serving his second term in the Rajya Sabha. Known to work with a team of around 20 trusted advisors, mostly graduates of top business schools, Goyal has facts, figures, spreadsheets on the activities of his ministry at his disposal at all times.\nPRAKASH JAVADEKAR | 68 Born: Jan 30, 1951Experience: 3 Rajya Sabha Terms\nA successful minister and astute political manager, Javadekar helmed three different ministries in the first Modi government. He was minister of state (independent charge) for environment, forests and climate change, a tenure he used to reduce red tape around clearances and to enforce pollution norms for industry in sensitive zones like along the Ganga.\nHe was also the minister of state for information and broadcasting and for parliamentary affairs, before being elevated to cabinet rank for the HRD portfolia, in which post he notably avoided the controversies his predecessor had got enmeshed in.\nJavadekar began working fulltime for BJP after resigning his job with Bank of Maharashtra in 1981.\nIn a 35-year-long association with the party, the 68-year-old Brahmin has held various organisational posts at the state and national levels, including general se cretary of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha.\nHis importance to the saffron party is reflected in his being given charge of states like Rajasthan and Karnataka which required deft handling of senior party leaders and concluding alliances with influential individuals.\nRAVI SHANKAR PRASAD | 64 Born: Aug 30, 1954Experience: 4 Rajya Sabha Terms\nHe is a familiar figure from television, a combative spokesperson for BJP. But the politician from Bihar also handled his other assignment, as Narendra Modi’s cabinet minister, first in the communications ministry and then in the law and justice ministry, with equanimity.\nAfter four terms as Rajya Sabha member, this year he contested the Lok Sabha polls against Shatrughan Sinha, who deserted BJP and was nominated by Congress from Patna Sahib. He scored a huge victory and earned another tenure as Modi’s minister. Beginning as an anti-Indira Gandhi student activist in the 1970s, he became associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh and ABVP during his youth.\nSince 1995, he has been an articulate member of the BJP national executive and won four times a seat in the Rajya Sabha, where he ably worked the aisles to ensure support for the government in a House where BJP lacked a majority.\nA senior advocate of the Supreme Court, the 64-year-old can be recalled as the main lawyer in the fodder case against RJD president Lalu Yadav.\nGAJENDRA SINGH SHEKHAWAT | 51 Born: Oct 3, 1967Experience: 1 Lok Sabha Term\nIn the past year, the tech-savvy and soft spoken Gajendra Singh Shekhawat has come to be considered the party high command’s chosen man in Rajasthan, someone who can be a replacement for former chief minister Vasundhara Raje.\nIronically, it was Raje’s attempts to stymie his nomination as the Rajasthan BJP chief last year that conferred on him instant recognition and popularity across the desert state. In the Lok Sabha elections, he had a difficult fight on hand against Vaibhav Gehlot, son of chief minister Ashok Gehlot, from Jodhpur. But for someone fighting only his second election, Shekhawat recorded a comfortable win, helped in some measure by PM Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah campaigning for him. Now 51, Shekhawat, a Rajput, began his political career in 1992 as president of the student union at Jodhpur’s Kai Narain Vyas University. He entered electoral politics in 2014, but by then he was closely associated with the Sangh Parivar.\nGIRIRAJ SINGH | 66 Born: Sept 8, 1952Experience: 1 Lok Sabha Term\nOne of the most watched battles in the general elections was CPI’s Kanhaiya Kumar taking on the seasoned Giriraj Singh of BJP in Bihar’s Begusarai constituency. In the event, Singh was able to notch up a huge victory, helped to no small measure by his familiarity with voters. He has been a frequent newsmaker with his controversial remarks about the need for bigger Hindu families. A Bhumihar Brahmin from Lakhisarai district of Bihar, Singh was member of the state legislative council for 12 years from 2002, joining the state minister in 2005, first as co-operatives minister and then then as animal husbandry minister from 2010 to 2013. A staunch supporter of PM Narendra Modi, Singh rode the saffron wave in 2014 to win a Lok Sabha seat from Nawada. Among the BJP ministers in Bihar to have lost their posts after the BJP-JDU break-up in 2013, Singh found himself rewarded with a place in Modi’s 2014 ministry as minister of state for micro, small and medium enterprises. His re-election this year has won him an elevation as a cabinet minister.\nARVIND SAWANT | 67 Born: Dec 31, 1951Experience: 1 Lok Sabha Term\nA hardcore Shiv Sainik who lives in a chawl in the Marathi heartland of Sewri, Arvind Sawant was among the Shiv Sena’s old guard. He has risen to become a two-term MP after defeating the Congress’s high-profile Milind Deora in Mumbai South, also becoming the national face of the party.\nSawant’s core strength has been his record as a trade unionist and a guardian of the rights of the sons of the soil. He controls the union of telephone employees — the Mahanagar Telephone Kamgar Sena. Aggressive and articulate, Sawant began his political innings in 1968 as a group leader in the party. His managerial skills and ability to get along with people soon pushed him ahead of others to become the deputy leader of the party. He has also served as an MLC.\nPRALHAD JOSHI | 56 Born: Nov 27, 1962Experience: 3 Lok Sabha Terms\nElected for the fourth time with a win margin of over 2 lakh votes from BJP-RSS stronghold of Dharwad, the longstanding RSS functionary’s political career took off back in 1992 when he participated, along with Uma Bharati in the Hubballi Idgah Maidan conflict in 1992, which led to a communal flare-up. He was state BJP president from 2012 to 2016 when the party’s five-year government ended amid serious allegations of graft, and scandals. He is believed to be best placed to replace the late H N Ananth Kumar as a bridge between the Centre and Karnataka, as he was the former’s understudy. Ananth Kumar’s brother Nand and Joshi’s brother Gopal are business partners and both families are very close.\nMUKHTAR A NAQVI | 61 Born: Oct 15, 1957Experience: 1 LS Term, 3 RS Terms\nOne of the most prominent Muslim faces of BJP, he made his electoral debut in 1980 when he won from Allahabad West assembly seat. He later joined BJP and is one of the few ministers in the newly inducted cabinet who has also served in Vajpayee’s government, including Rajnath Singh and Santosh Gangwar.\nHe was elected to Lok Sabha from Rampur in 1998, and was subsequently given the post of MoS for information and broadcasting in the Vajpayee government. He became MoS for minority affairs and parliamentary affairs in 2014. He got independent charge of the ministry. He has now been elevated to cabinet position.\nMAHENDRA N PANDEY | 61 Born: Oct 15, 1957Experience: 1 Lok Sabha Term\nUttar Pradesh BJP chief and Chandauli MP Mahendra Nath Pandey has been rewarded after the party’s impressive performance in the Lok Sabha polls in the state. A Brahmin from eastern UP, Pandey’s constituency is adjacent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Varanasi seat. He was MoS for human resource development in 2016-17 before being sent to UP to head the party’s state unit. Pandey is credited with leading the party against a formidable SP-BSP alliance and notching up a good tally and seamlessly running the party machinery in sync with chief minister Yogi Adityanath.\nRAMESH N POKHRIYAL | 59 Born: July 15, 1959\nBefore starting his political journey, Nishank, 59, worked as a teacher in Shishu Mandir, a school under RSS’s Vidya Bharti, in Dehradun. His RSS background came handy when this gardener’s son joined the BJP. In 1991, he was first elected from Karnaprayag assembly seat to the UP assembly for the first time.\nHe went on to win the seat again in 1993 and 1996. He was a minister in the UP cabinet and then in 2000, after Uttarakhand was formed, Nishank bagged high-profile portfolios. From 2009 to 2011, he was the Uttarakhand chief minister.\nSADANANDA GOWDA| 66 Born: March 18, 1953\nGowda, popularly called DVS in his home state of Karnataka, belongs to the Vokkaliga community and, after the death of H N Ananth Kumar, is among the most important BJP leaders from that state. He had a short tenure as chief minister of Karnataka a year between 2011 and 2012).\nAfter his election to the Lok Sabha from Bangalore North, he was inducted in the Union ministry, where he variously held the charges of railways, law and statistics & programme implementation ministries.\nTHAWARCHAND GEHLOT | 71 Born: May 18, 1948Experience: 4 Lok Sabha Terms\nAn easily recognised schedule caste face in BJP, Gehlot played a crucial role in containing discontentment in the SC community over the amendment of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. He was minister for social justice and empowerment then and has been rewarded with a continued run as cabinet ministerThe 71-year-old Rajya Sabha member from Madhya Pradesh joined the Bharatiya Jan Sangh in 1962. He spent 10 months in jail for participating in the 1968-71 workers’ agitation and was also detained during the Emergency.\nARJUN MUNDA | 51 Born: May 3, 1968Experience: 1 Lok Sabha Term\nThe former CM is the lone member in the Cabinet from Jharkhand. The three-term CM, who has the distinction of holding the post for the longest period in the politically tumultuous state, won the reserved tribal seat of Khunti by a slim margin despite it being considered as a lost cause by BJP. Known as a crisis manager, he was just 35 when he was first chosen to lead the state in 2002 after NDA alliance partners sought the ouster of then CM Babulal Marandi. Munda went on to helm the state for two more terms.\nMinisters of State (Independent Charge)\nSantosh Gangwar|70 7 Lok Sabha Terms\nIn his eighth win from Bareilly, the seasoned politician retained his place in the cabinet, where he served as MoS labour and employment in Modi’s first ministry.

He has held a relatively light portfolio given his seniority, partly because of his outspoken comments and his penchant of tangling with state BJP leaders.\n \nShripad Naik|664 Lok Sabha Terms\nA founder member of BJP in Goa, Naik has won the North Goa seat for the fifth consecutive time. He held independent charge of the Ayush ministry in Modi’s first Cabinet. Naik was also minister in the Vajpayee government.\nJitendra Singh|621 Lok Sabha Term\nElected for the second time from J&K’s Udhampur, Singh held portfolios such as that of the PMO, DoPT and atomic energy. Soon after he took charge in 2014, he courted controversy by demanding the repeal of Article 370.\nKiren Rijiju|472 Lok Sabha Terms\nThe MoS for home in the last government, he was seen to have handled his ministerial assignment well, with a flair for interacting with para military and police personnel. This was Rijiju’s third Lok Sabha poll victory.\nPrahlad Patel|584 Lok Sabha Terms\nOnce junior coal mantri in AB Vajpayee’s government, the OBC neta is a five-time parliamentarian and was a front-runner for Modi’s second Cabinet.

The 17 Squadron used to operate the MiG-21s earlier and is 'number-plated' at the moment.\nThe first Rafale is expected to be handed over to the Indian Air Force in September 2019 but it would be required to undergo intensive 1,500 hours of testing to validate the India Specific Enhancements on it. So, the first batch of the four planes is likely to arrive at Ambala around May 2020.\nAmbala base has been housing Jaguar aircraft squadrons mainly looking after the Pakistan front but due to rapid deployment capabilities, the planes can be utilised on both the fronts in case of requirement. Dassault's Rafale is a state-of-the-art flying machine whose presence will significantly help India's armed forces.\nIn September 2016, India signed a deal with the French government and Dassault Aviation to acquire 36 Rafale fighter jets for over Euro 7.8 billion to arrest the fall of combat squadrons and meet urgent requirements on the eastern and western fronts.The plan to deploy one squadron of the planes at the Saraswat air base in Uttar Pradesh did not work out due to land acquisition issues.\n"},{titleMax:"After 'Divider in Chief', TIME magazine now says 'Modi united India like no PM in decades'",titleMin:"Time in its cover story before the elections had called Prime Minister Narendra Modi the 'Divider in Chief'.",author:"",articleSource:"",articleDate:"May 30, 2019, 09.44 AM IST",imageUrl:"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-69558577,width-300,imgsize-424224,resizemode-4/times.jpg",mainBody:"NEW YORK: Weeks after TIME magazine featured Narendra Modi on the cover of its international edition with a controversial headline, it has now run an article that says no prime minister has united India in decades the way he has done.\nThe article titled ‘Modi Has United India Like No Prime Minister in Decades' is written by Manoj Ladwa, founder and chief executive of the India Inc Group, a London-based media organisation.\nThe article comes just days after BJP secured a landslide victory in the country's general elections, winning 303 seats in the 542-member Lok Sabha.\n“Despite the strong and often unfair criticisms leveled at Modi's policies both throughout his first term and this marathon election, no Prime Minister has united the Indian electorate as much in close to five decades,\" Ladwa writes.\nLadwa, who in 2014 had led the Research Analysis and Messaging division of the Narendra Modi for Prime Minister campaign, further writes that Modi won a massive mandate as he managed to transcend India's greatest fault line: the class divide.\nThe article is published in the TIME Ideas section, which the publication said “hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary on events in news, society, and culture.”\n \nThe article is in stark contrast to the TIME cover story done on Modi earlier this month titled ‘India's Divider in Chief', written by Aatish Taseer, son of Indian journalist Tavleen Singh and late Pakistani politician and businessman Salmaan Taseer.\nAs Modi enters his second term as leader of the world's largest democracy, Ladwa writes that he still has work to do.\n \n“Having plugged some horrendous holes in India's notoriously inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy in his first term, he will now need to focus much more ruthlessly on reforming those institutions and make them fit for the coming decades. This will require him to remain the pragmatic politician he is, and continue to shun the temptations of populism as he sets out his stall for a second term.\"\nWhile all achievements of the Modi's government are still “works-in-progress”, Ladwa said that its efforts have been recognised by virtually every single global institute of any standing, including the World Bank, the IMF, and the UN, and “Modi's India is finally progressing at a rate worthy of its size and potential.\n“Modi may have been criticised for remaining silent during incidents of social unrest. But his work has been given the thumbs up at the ballot box by the Indian voters for directly addressing the root causes of some of India's divisions. For them, the Modi dream of a New India remains very much intact,” Ladwa added.\nIn another article titled ‘India's Economy Needs Tougher Reform. How Will Modi Use His Election Mandate?' published on the TIME website, Alyssa Ayres, senior fellow for India, Pakistan, and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, writes that the “continuity of a second Modi term, then, suggests to some that a bold economic reform agenda may be what comes next.”\nAyres, who served as US deputy assistant secretary of state for South Asia from 2010 to 2013 under the Obama Administration, said due to his pro-business orientation and road-show pitches for investment, Modi has gained a reputation among US industry as someone with a reformist mindset.\n“We may well see the new Modi government storm into its new term with a bang, tackling market access problems and liberalizing the economy further to boost economic growth.\n\"It could happen. But equally possible might be an approach that continues a focus on infrastructure, sanitation and other development projects necessary for improved prosperity but not necessarily keys to unlocking greater bilateral trade and investment,” Ayres writes. \n"},{titleMax:"Filing ITR-1 this year? You must know about these changes",titleMin:"While filing ITR-1 for FY 2018-19, here are six procedural changes that you must know about.",author:"Preeti Motiani",articleSource:"",articleDate:"May 31, 2019, 11.10 AM IST",imageUrl:"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-69477998,width-300,imgsize-202719,resizemode-4/tax4-thinkstock.jpg",mainBody:"If you are filing ITR-1 this year, then there are several procedural changes you must know about. Being aware of these changes will make it easier for you to file your income tax return.\nHere are the changes that you must know.\n Addition of new tab for section 80GGA\nThis year in the online form of ITR-1, a new tab for section 80GGA has been added. If you wish to claim deduction under section 80GGA, then you are required to enter the details in the new tab. \nSection 80GGA provides deduction for the donations made towards scientific research/rural development. However, individuals with business income cannot claim this deduction.\nChartered Accountant, Naveen Wadhwa, DGM,Taxmann.com says, \"Any individual who wishes to claim this deduction will be required to furnish additional information - relevant clause under which deduction is claimed, name and address of the donee, PAN of donee and amount of donation made in cash and any other mode. The new schedule seeks detailed information to rule out false claims in ITRs.\"\nRemember, donations in excess of Rs 10,000 in cash are not allowed as deduction. Also, 100 percent of the amount donated is eligible for deduction under this section.\n Changes in reporting of exempted incomes\nIn last year's ITR-1, you were required to report exempted incomes under the head 'Taxes Paid and Verification'. However, this year, these incomes will have to be reported under the tab, 'Computation of income and taxes'. Wadhwa says, \"This is now a coherent replacement as it belongs to income schedules only.\"\nIn addition to that, last year, while reporting exempted incomes, you were required to report tax-exempt portion of allowances such as HRA (house rent allowance) received from your employer, under this head. This year, tax-exempt portion of allowances received will be reported while filling salary details in ITR-1.\n Validating your bank account on e-filing website for faster credit of tax refunds\nThe income tax department has decided to issue only e-refunds from March 1, 2019. E-refunds will be issued to only those bank accounts that are validated on the e-filing website and are linked with filer's PAN. \nIf your PAN is not linked with your bank account or your bank account is not validated on the e-filing website of the income tax department, then it is likely your tax refunds will be delayed.\n Choosing of verification option \nWhen filing ITR-1 in the previous year, while selecting details such as ITR form, assessment year and so on, you were also required to choose the ITR verification option with which you will be verifying your ITR. \nHowever, this year, this option has been moved under the 'Taxes Paid and Verification' head. Once the ITR-1 form on the website is filled with all the required details, then you will have to choose the option with which you want to verify your ITR. Wadhwa says, \"Earlier, verification method was asked at the time of selecting or uploading the relevant ITR form. This is now a logical placement of 'Verification' options.\"\nHowever, if you are filing your ITR using Excel utility, i.e., by uploading an XML file, then you are required to choose the verification option while selecting details such as ITR form as mentioned above.\n Detailed break-up of donation made under section 80G\nIf you have made any donations in FY 2018-19, then you will be required to provide the detailed break-up of how much of it was in cash and how much using banking channels. \"This has been done to curtail the misuse of section 80G for donations made,\" adds Wadhwa.\nUnder section 80G, you can claim deduction for donations made to certain notified funds, charitable institutions or notified institutions set-up by the government.\n Lesser information is pre-filled\nIn a departure from the previous year, this year there is less pre-filled information while filing ITR-1 online on the e-filing website. \nWadhwa says, \"Up to last year, when TDS details were imported from tax passbook (Form 26AS), the fields of Salary Income and Income from Other Sources were also filled with the gross payments subjected to such TDS. This year, the data is imported only in TDS Schedules and not in the income schedules. It appears that the department has deliberately disabled this practice because of two reasons - first, if an income field is pre-filled with certain numbers, the taxpayers might get afraid from changing it and certain income would not be reported in ITR. Second, this year, additional information is required to be disclosed for the income to be reported in ITR 1/ITR 4, thus, it would not be possible for the department to pre-fill the relevant field.\"\n"},{titleMax:"Gaurs Group: Real Estate major reports gross sales revenue of over Rs 4,000 Crores in FY 2018-19",titleMin:"Biggest ever sale in the realty sector of the region.",author:"",articleSource:"",articleDate:"May 29, 2019, 02.50 PM IST",imageUrl:"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-69555018,width-300,imgsize-167673,resizemode-4/real-estate-major-gaurs-group.jpg",mainBody:'Gaurs Group, one of the major real estate developers in the country, has posted the biggest ever sale in the realty sector of the region by selling more than 10,000 units for gross revenue of around Rs 4,000 Crores in FY 2018 -19.

These 2 projects would also start in the second or third quarter of this financial year. \n \nHOSPITALITY\nThe real estate giant also has some attractive plans in the area of hospitality. The Gaurs Sarovar Portico,a 72 Keys Mice Destination, at Gaur City Club, Greater Noida West is proposed to open in 3rd Quarter of 2019.

The Group is geared up to repeat this success story in Education and has already started construction of 2 more schools – one at Yamuna Expressway within its 250-acre township, Gaur Yamuna City and the second at Siddharth Vihar, Ghaziabad within its Group Housing project – Gaurs Siddhartham.

Whoever takes Jaitley's place will have to draw up a budget due to be presented in July. \n The government is widely expected to deliver some fiscal stimulus while keeping the deficit at manageable levels. On the plus side, the Reserve Bank of India could have leeway to reduce interest rates as inflation remains subdued.\n The gross domestic product data for January-March quarter and provisional estimates for the whole 2018/19 fiscal year ending in March will be released on Friday around 1200 GMT.\n The RBI has lowered its economic growth forecast for 2019/20 fiscal year beginning April to 7.2%.\n The central bank's monetary policy committee (MPC), which has cut policy rates by 50 basis points this year, is expected to cut the repo rate by a further 25 basis points at its June 4-6 meeting, bringing it to 5.75%, the lowest since July 2010.\n Retail inflation has stayed below 3 percent for last six months, possibly low enough to take the risk of cutting rates without waiting to seeing whether the monsoon rainy season starting next month holds any danger of a spike in food prices.\n Several indicators - automobile sales, rail freight, petroleum product consumption, domestic air traffic and imports indicate a slowdown in domestic consumption. \n Corporate earnings hit a six-quarter low growth of 10.7% during January-March quarter on weakening consumer sentiment and softening commodity prices, ICRA, the Indian arm of the ratings agency Moody's said on Tuesday, citing a sample of over 300 companies. \n \"The signs of slowdown in domestic demand are visible both in urban and rural areas,\" Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry said in a statement earlier this week, while submitting pre-budget demands to the finance ministry.\n Industry chambers have lobbied for a fiscal stimulus including a cut in corporate tax rates and lower interest rates.\n The government could front-load its budget spending and announce some tax sops for individual tax payers and companies, a senior finance ministry official told Reuters, while citing fiscal constraints due to a slower growth in tax receipts.\n But some economists said monetary and fiscal stimulus could have a limited impact. \n They fear the economy is in danger of a prolonged phase of slower growth due to stagnant rural wages, rising real interest costs for manufacturers and reluctance to lend among banks and non-bank finance firms due to alarmingly high defaults.\n \"While cyclical challenges can be addressed through short-term measures, the need of the hour is to address the structural challenges plaguing the Indian economy,\" said Sunil Kumar Sinha, economist at India Ratings and Research, the arm of Fitch ratings agency. \n Some finance ministry officials have suggested Modi's government could push long pending reforms, related to land acquisition and labour, during the coming year, though it will have to coordinate with state governments. \n"}]}}},["U1cT"]);
